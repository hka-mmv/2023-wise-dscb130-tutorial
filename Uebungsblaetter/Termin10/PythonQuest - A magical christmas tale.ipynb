    "## Task 1: Sweet Hot Chocolate Break\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyra's first task is to lend her coding expertise to the Elves, who are eager to create delicious hot chocolate for the holiday season. The key ingredient? A festive bar of chocolate that needs to be broken into pieces.  The chocolate bar is a grid with dimensions $w \\times h$ where $w$ represents the width and $h$ represents the length. However, there are strict rules to follow:\n",

    "- The chocolate can only be broken along predetermined breaking points.\n",
    "- It is forbidden to place pieces of chocolate on top of each other or next to each other.\n",

    "The Elves are counting on Pyra to create a function, `min_chocolate_breaks`, that takes the dimensions of the chocolate bar and calculates the minimum number of operations needed to break it into it's pieces. Pyra, aims to ensure that the Elves can enjoy their hot chocolate without any chocolate mishaps.\n",
